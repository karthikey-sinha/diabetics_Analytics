 # Diabetes Data Analysis & Visualization

This project explores and visualizes a diabetes dataset using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy**.
It calculates statistical measures such as mean, variance, and standard deviation, and uses various plots to uncover insights about diabetic patients.



##  Features

* **Statistical Analysis**:

  * Mean, variance, and standard deviation of patient ages.
* **Data Visualization**:

  * **Boxplots** for Age, BMI, and Blood Pressure.
  * **Histograms** to explore age and BMI distribution among patients.
  * **Scatter plots** for:

    * Hours studied vs. exam scores (sample dataset).
    * BMI vs. disease progression.
    * S5 (blood type measure) vs. disease progression.



## Installation

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib numpy
```

---

##  Usage

1. Place the `diabetese.tsv` file in the project directory.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python diabetes_analysis.py
```

3. The script will:

   * Print statistical summaries.
   * Display multiple visualizations for better data understanding.

##  Example Insights

* **Average Age** of diabetic patients.
* BMI distribution and its correlation with disease progression.
* Relationship between medical measures (S5, BP, etc.) and disease outcome.

---

##  Dataset

The `diabetese.tsv` dataset contains:

* **AGE** – Patient's age (years)
* **BMI** – Body Mass Index
* **BP** – Blood Pressure
* **S5** – Blood type measure
* **Y** – Disease progression score

## Skills Demonstrated

* Python Programming
* Pandas (Data Loading, Cleaning, Analysis)
* NumPy (Statistical Calculations)
* Matplotlib (Boxplot, Histogram, Scatter Plot)
* Data Analysis & Visualization
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
